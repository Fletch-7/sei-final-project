Negotiation is one of those skills that are important for any job. Whether you\u2019re negotiating for an offer in an interview or negotiating for a raise with your company, there are some simple things that you should follow to yield better results. Recently I was discussing in a twitter thread that is discussing salary discussion and how to negotiate better. I attended almost 30 interviews before joining on my current job and turned down most of the offers I got in the salary negotiation round. I can say that I learned a thing or two in those situations and that twitter thread gave me enough motivation to write this down. Note 1: This is written mostly based on the Indian job market and I am not aware of any other country\u2019s job market, but most of these points can be applied to any job anywhere. Note 2: This is written with experienced developers in mind. If you\u2019re on the first 3 years of your carrier you might be still learning a lot, you\u2019re welcome to read this post but I am not recommending this advice for you.

You should be aware of the average market rates for your skillset and experience. Companies will mostly try to stick within the market average unless they\u2019re in need of an urgent resource. But in most organizations this information is confidential and one should not reveal how much they\u2019re getting paid to their peers. This is partly for good reasons and partly used by some companies to take advantage of people. So the only way to get this information is to get it from the community of developers around you. Go to your local meetup group, WhatsApp/telegram groups for developers and try to talk to them about it. To yield better results, share an anonymous form with the group and you\u2019ll have a better chance of getting that information. There are online sources of information such as Payscale which provides this information along with further advice on your career path, but I am skeptical about the accuracy of the information. Recently there was also a twitter trend #KnowYourWorth in which a lot of people posted how much they make and someone did a stellar job of making a beautiful website with that information grouped by countries. Chances are twitter might be more accurate than payscale\u2019s data because it is very recent. I suggest you use two or three methods of finding th",
